    "# Implications of Data Collection, Storage, and Data Biases\n",
    "### Ethical Implications\n",
    "Ethically speaking there are some concerns about this data and the model. Firstly, while the data is technically anonymous, the data being stored is identifying data. A threat agent could theoretically look at the training data and narrow down potential customers of FoodX by filtering University, Year, and Major. It also contains time data of when they might visit again. While this data is not crucial, any data in the hands of threat agents is a threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while this may seem like a given, the users of FoodX must be informed that there data is being stored and used by FoodX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Outcome Implications\n",
    "A model that can predict what a user would like to eat is useful for both advertising and app customization. For example, if FoodX were trying to get more customers, they could use the prediction that a Year 3, Computer Science Student at Indiana State University has a %67 likely hood of liking Sugar Cream Pie to target in their advertising. FoodX could have an targeted advertisement to those characteristics and show them an add displaying a delicious Sugar Cream Pie.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the side of app customization, an already existing user could have new foods suggested to them if a model like this predicts that they would enjoy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implications\n",
    "The primary technical implications of an order prediction model are hosting the model and updating it. For the model to be used dynamically it would likely need hosted on a server. This might not however be necessary if the model was only used a script on some occasions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is only as good as its training data so as FoodX gets more customers and therefore more data. It would be ideal to update the model on an ongoing basis to increase the accuracy of both the model itself and the accuracy score."

    "# Practicality\n",
    "#### The Model's State and Training data\n",
    "The highest accuracy model I was able to produce was 67.666% accurate. This is not quite the accuracy desired for a prediction model. Ideally, the model would reach at least 75% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect that this lack in accuracy is due to the training data. The training data has a significantly greater number of customers who are Year 2 and 3 then Years 1 and 4. Additionally, the times are not very encompassing and the model could be far better with a larger data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is solid as it stands, however, it would be far better if the model had a more diverse and vast data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "I already spoke to some of the potential applications of advertising and app customization in the section on implications, however, it is important to note just how important those applications are.\n",
    "\n",
    "If FoodX can use this model to reduce the cost per new customer, then that would be absolutely huge for its business. In a similar vein, greater app customization would likely increase the frequency of returning customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "This model has a relatively low initial cost of time and resources as well an inexpensive maintenance cost. However, the impact of this prediction model is massive. Due to the leverage of the prediction model it is a viable allocation of resources that would properly utilize the tools that machine learning provides."
